93/100, good paper
[[Chemistakes]]
MCQ 15/15, all went well
Q16 - Entropy and [[Enthalpy and Entropy]] 10/10
		[[Lattice Enthalpy]] atomisation is one mole of element, not molecule - 1/2 O2 forms one mole so no need to half
Q17 - [[Rates]] No marks dropped, quite easy
Q18 - [[Equilibrium]] 1 mark lost due to not reading question/not addressing both parts. Slow down and just answer exactly what q wants
Q19 - [[Acids, Bases, Buffers]] No marks lost but get better at drawing pH curves for titrations, do dot to dot for curve then draw **in one go**
Q20 - [[Bonding]] mark lost due to not reading question again/not addressing all parts of question
Q21 - [[Redox & Electrode Potentials]] Worst question, 2 marks lost to genuine [[knowledge gaps]]
Q22 - [[Transition Elements]] another bad question relatively, forgot s orbital is spherical and somewhat struggles with Haemoglobin q, but remembered anki card
