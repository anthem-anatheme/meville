# Mistake: MnO4- Reduction Equation

- **Date:** 2025-06-01
- **Subject:** Chemistry
- **Topic:** [[Redox & Electrode Potentials]]
- **Mistake Type:** Knowledge gap
- **Source (Paper/Question):** PMT Predicted Paper
- **What was the mistake?**  
  Didn't know equation of reduction of MnO4- by H2O2 in alkaline conditions so struggled to answer question that requires ratio of how much H2O2 reacts with MnO4- ion.
- **Correct Answer/Concept:**  Equation not actually needed, just use knowledge from redox - electrons lost from one species must be gained by another
- **Why did I make this mistake?**  Misunderstanding aim of question
- **How will I avoid it next time?**
