Pretty easy paper tbh, had a bit of trouble with [[Mitosis]] but i think it came to me after a while.

Perhaps missed a mark on [[Cell Fractionation]] to obtain nucleus - 6 marks is too much I feel but I wrote down everything I could remember. 

Calculation was slightly odd on heart stroke volume question because ~ was replaced by -ve sign so very confusing.

Q5 had missing diagram so had to guess, will try to find diagram from link to answer question later.

Paper 2 should be much harder.
