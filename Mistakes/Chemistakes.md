[[Enthalpy and Entropy]] combustion always negative
[[Lattice Enthalpy]] - check state symbols every line in cycle
[[Acids,Bases, Buffers]] - units, ionic equations just write down whats involved in redox reaction
[[Lattice Enthalpy]] - STATE SYMBOLS!
[[Acids,Bases, Buffers]] - Check if q wants initial or equillibrium concentration, pay attention and write it down in sight
