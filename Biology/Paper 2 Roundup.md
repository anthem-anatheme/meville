- Control of heart rate - More signals from medulla to SAN (through sympathetic)
- Respiration for exercise -> mention ATP
	- Actually, just always mention ATP production with respiration/exercise
- When given graph, always refer back to it
- Biomass = dry mass or mass of carbon
- Prolonged exercise → anaerobic respiration and lactate production
- Ratios always given x:1 format
- Synapses/Action Potential Transmission → Na+ ions influx
- Epigenetics mentioned → Methylation of gene or Acetylation of histone
-
