- Control of heart rate - More signals from medulla to SAN (through sympathetic)
- Respiration for exercise -> mention ATP
	- Actually, just always mention ATP production with respiration/exercise
- When given graph, always refer back to it
- Biomass = dry mass or mass of carbon
- Prolonged exercise → anaerobic respiration and lactate production
- Ratios always given x:1 format
- Synapses/Action Potential Transmission → Na+ ions influx
- Epigenetics mentioned → Methylation of gene or Acetylation of histone
- CO2 uptake in photosynthesis - What is CO2 used for and why is that changed due to the condition? Use all the names of the molecules if more than 1 mark; GP,TP,RuBP,Rubisco, etc
