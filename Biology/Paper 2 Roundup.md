### **[[Biology 2017 Paper 2.pdf|2017]]** - 7/10
- Control of heart rate - More signals from medulla to SAN (through sympathetic)
- Respiration for exercise -> mention ATP
	- Actually, just always mention ATP production with respiration/exercise
- When given graph, always refer back to it
- Biomass = dry mass or mass of carbon
- Prolonged exercise → anaerobic respiration and lactate production
- Ratios always given x:1 format
- Synapses/Action Potential Transmission → Na+ ions influx
- Epigenetics mentioned → Methylation of gene or Acetylation of histone

#### **2018** 7/10
- For photosynthesis questions, always refer to molecules produced when possible - ATP, NADH, GP, TP, etc
- Log scale used for large difference in numbers - don't just say large numbers
- If giving number of trials for quadrat, just double what you think (at least 20)
- For urine/water reabsorption, always refer to water potential if possible

#### **2019** - 8/10
- Stem cells divide and differentiate + replenish themselves
	- 1 stem cell -> Stem cell + differentiated cell
- Evaluate questions - Side effects, negatives, long term effects
	- Be the biggest hater for whatever scientists are saying
- Plants used in experiment will lose water by evaporation/transpiration - lid or some other barrier to prevent water loss so water potential is kept constant
- Read the whole question jfc
- Gluconeogenesis -mention fatty acids/amino acids, etc being converted to glucose
- For 2nd messenger - cAMP activates **protein kinase enzymes** that activate enzymes for glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
- DNA probes single stranded *and* complementary to specific allele - whole purpose is to detect an allele
- Muscle contraction and action potential → *neuromuscular junction or sarcolemma*
- Single stranded DNA/mRNA → *Complementary Base Pairing*
