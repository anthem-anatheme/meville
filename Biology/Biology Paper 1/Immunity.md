humoral response - phagocytes detect foreign antigen and engulf pathogen in phagosome, fuses with lysosome and hydrolytic enzymes hydrolyse pathogen. Products are released by exocytosis and antigens displayed in cell surface membrane (APC)
Cell mediated T cell - Th cell with complementary receptor specific to antigen fuses
