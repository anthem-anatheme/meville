---

### **5.4.1(a) Definition of Lattice Enthalpy**

**Markscheme Note:**

- *Lattice enthalpy* is “the enthalpy change when 1 mole of an ionic compound is formed from its gaseous ions under standard conditions.”
- Always exothermic (negative value).

**Explanation:**

- Represents the strength of ionic bonding in the lattice.
- The more negative, the stronger the ionic bonds.

**Example Exam Question:**
> **Q:** Define the term lattice enthalpy for sodium chloride and write an equation to represent it.
> **A:** “Enthalpy change when 1 mole of NaCl is formed from its gaseous ions.”
> Equation: Na⁺(g) + Cl⁻(g) → NaCl(s)[^6][^9]

**Common Mistake:**

- Confusing formation (exothermic, negative) with dissociation (endothermic, positive).

### **5.4.1(b) Born–Haber Cycles**

**Markscheme Note:**

- A *Born–Haber cycle* is “an energy cycle used to calculate lattice enthalpy indirectly, using enthalpy changes of formation, atomisation, ionisation, and electron affinity.”
- All steps must be shown with correct species and state symbols.

**Explanation:**

- Uses Hess’s Law to relate lattice enthalpy to other measurable enthalpy changes.

**Example Exam Question:**
> **Q:** Complete the Born–Haber cycle for CaO by adding the missing species with state symbols.
> **A:** Ca(s), Ca(g), Ca²⁺(g), O₂(g), O(g), O²⁻(g), CaO(s)[^8][^9]

**Common Mistake:**

- Omitting steps (e.g. atomisation, second ionisation/electron affinity) or incorrect state symbols.

---

### **5.4.1(c) Calculating Lattice Enthalpy Using Born–Haber Cycles**

**Markscheme Note:**

- Apply Hess’s Law:
ΔH°f = Σ(all other steps) + ΔH°latt
Rearranged: ΔH°latt = ΔH°f – Σ(all other steps)
- Correct signs and multipliers are essential.

**Explanation:**

- Substitute values for each enthalpy change, ensuring correct stoichiometry.

**Example Exam Question:**
> **Q:** Given enthalpy data for MgBr₂, calculate the lattice enthalpy.
> **A:**
> - Write out the cycle with correct species.
> - Substitute values (e.g., ΔH°latt = –2433 kJ mol⁻¹)[^8]

**Common Mistake:**

- Wrong sign for enthalpy changes, forgetting to multiply for diatomic elements or multiple ions.

### **5.4.1(d) Factors Affecting Lattice Enthalpy**

**Markscheme Note:**

- “Lattice enthalpy becomes more exothermic with increasing ionic charge and decreasing ionic radius.”
- “Greater attraction from smaller ions or higher charge density.”

**Explanation:**

- Stronger ionic bonds = more negative lattice enthalpy.
- Explains trends in melting points and stability.

**Example Exam Question:**
> **Q:** Explain why NaBr has a higher melting point than KI.
> **A:** “Na⁺ and Br⁻ are smaller than K⁺ and I⁻, so there is greater attraction between ions in NaBr. More energy is needed to overcome these attractions, so NaBr has a higher melting point.”[^8]

**Common Mistake:**

- Referring to atoms/molecules instead of ions; not comparing both charge and size.

---

### **5.4.1(e) Enthalpy of Solution and Hydration**

**Markscheme Note:**

- “The enthalpy change of solution can be calculated using lattice enthalpy and hydration enthalpies in an energy cycle.”
- ΔH°sol = ΣΔH°hyd (ions) – ΔH°latt

**Explanation:**

- Used to predict solubility and compare to experimental values.

**Example Exam Question:**
> **Q:** Given lattice and hydration enthalpies, calculate the enthalpy change of solution for KCl.
> **A:** Substitute values into the equation, giving the correct sign and units.[^6]

**Common Mistake:**

- Incorrect signs or omitting a hydration enthalpy.
