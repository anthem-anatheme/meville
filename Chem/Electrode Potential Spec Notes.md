### **5.5.3 (a): Standard Electrode Potentials and the Standard Hydrogen Electrode**

**Markscheme Notes:**

- **Definition:**
The standard electrode potential, \$ E^\circ \$, is the potential difference measured when a half-cell is connected to a standard hydrogen electrode under standard conditions[^2][^3][^4].
- **Standard conditions:**
298 K, 100 kPa, 1.00 mol dm⁻³ solutions[^2][^3][^4].
- **Standard hydrogen electrode (SHE):**
A platinum electrode in contact with H₂ gas at 100 kPa and 1 mol dm⁻³ H⁺(aq), at 298 K, is assigned \$ E^\circ = 0.00 \$ V[^2][^3][^4].
- **Diagram:**

```
Pt | H2(g, 1 atm) | H+(aq, 1 mol dm⁻³)
```

- **Explanation:**
All other electrode potentials are measured relative to the SHE, which serves as the universal reference[^2].

**Common Mistakes:**

- Omitting or incorrectly stating standard conditions.
- Failing to use a platinum electrode for the SHE.

### **5.5.3 (b): Setting Up and Measuring Standard Cells**

**Markscheme Notes:**

- **Experimental setup:**
    - Two half-cells, each with an electrode and 1 mol dm⁻³ solution of its ions[^3][^4].
    - Salt bridge (e.g., filter paper soaked in KNO₃) connecting the solutions[^3][^4].
    - High-resistance voltmeter and external circuit[^2][^3][^4].
    - Label all apparatus and standard conditions[^3][^4].
- **Diagram (from markschemes):**

```
[Metal(s)] | [Metal ion(aq, 1 mol dm⁻³)] || [Metal ion(aq, 1 mol dm⁻³)] | [Metal(s)]
```

- **Explanation:**
The salt bridge maintains electrical neutrality by allowing ions to flow between half-cells[^3][^4].

**Common Mistakes:**

- Not labelling the salt bridge or voltmeter.
- Not specifying standard conditions or using “1 mole” instead of “1 mol dm⁻³”.

### **5.5.3 (c): Calculating Standard Cell Potentials**

**Markscheme Notes:**

- **Formula:**
\$ E_{cell}^\circ = E^\circ_{right} - E^\circ_{left} \$[^3][^4][^5].
- **Assignment:**
The more positive electrode is the right-hand (reduction) side; the more negative is the left-hand (oxidation) side[^3][^4][^5].
- **Direction of electron flow:**
From the more negative to the more positive electrode[^3][^4][^5].
- **Explanation:**
A positive cell potential indicates a feasible reaction[^3][^5].

**Common Mistakes:**

- Reversing the order in the calculation.
- Not identifying which half-cell is oxidation/reduction.

---

### **5.5.3 (d): Writing Cell Diagrams and Half-Cell Equations**

**Markscheme Notes:**

- **Cell notation:**
\$ Zn(s) | Zn^{2+}(aq) || Cu^{2+}(aq) | Cu(s) \$[^3][^4].
- **Half-cell equations:**
Must be balanced for atoms and charge, with electrons on the correct side[^3][^4].
- **Use of platinum electrode:**
For half-cells with only ions (e.g., Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺), use Pt(s) as the electrode[^3][^4].
- **Explanation:**
Cell notation always lists the oxidation (anode) on the left, reduction (cathode) on the right[^3][^4].

**Common Mistakes:**

- Omitting Pt for ion-only half-cells.
- Incorrect or unbalanced half-cell equations.

---

### **5.5.3 (e): Predicting Feasibility of Redox Reactions**

**Markscheme Notes:**

- **Feasibility:**
A redox reaction is feasible if \$ E_{cell}^\circ > 0 \$[^3][^5].
- **Identifying agents:**
The species with the more positive \$ E^\circ \$ is the oxidising agent (undergoes reduction); the more negative is the reducing agent (undergoes oxidation)[^3][^5].
- **Explanation:**
Compare E° values to predict which direction the reaction proceeds[^3][^5].

**Common Mistakes:**

- Not comparing E° values correctly.
- Stating ions instead of full species as oxidising/reducing agents.

---

### **5.5.3 (f): Effects of Concentration, Temperature, and Pressure**

**Markscheme Notes:**

- **Concentration:**
Increasing the concentration of the oxidised species makes E° more positive; increasing the reduced species makes E° less positive[^2].
- **Le Chatelier’s principle:**
Used to explain the effect of changes in conditions on electrode potential[^2].
- **Explanation:**
Standard electrode potentials are only valid under standard conditions[^2].

**Common Mistakes:**

- Ignoring the effect of non-standard conditions on E°.
