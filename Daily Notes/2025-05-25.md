Fun day, got up kinda early and had shower then maths paper. Pretty easy but some silly mistakes to be ironed out, completing square wrong, set notation slipup etc but pretty good. Finally got obsidian git sync to work with windows and IOS, credit to Luc Wallace for basically holding my hand. Then did some mistakes logging for chem, and a chemistry paper 1 (2024). Not marked but pretty easy paper, one or two things I didnâ€™t know/forgot such as the shape of s and p orbitals but nothing very tricky tbh. Did some light mechanics work, gotta be drilled better since I still struggle with not very difficult questions so gotta get proficient for the A*. Played some val with people and lost a ton but had fun so what does it matter. Overall decent day, productivity 6/10, fun 7/10. More work to be done tomorrow following early wakeup.
