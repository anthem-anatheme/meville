- If comparing melting points, check if any have hydrogen bonding (F,O,N, and a hydrogen)
- Systematic name - oxidation state goes at end, in bracketed roman numerals
- For entropy, always talk about increase in disorder/more possible states
- For gas collection - Measuring Cylinder or Gas Syringe, with correct capacity and markings 
	- Or measure loss of mass - as gas produced mass will decrease
- Electrode potentials - Most negative is strongest reducing agent, positive is strongest oxidising agent

- âˆ†H hydration when one mole of **gaseous ions** dissolve in water to form one mole of **hydrated ions**
	- Affected by ionic radius and charge - attraction to **H2O molecules**
- Average bond enthalpy when one mole of bonds is broken, **in gaseous molecules**
- Arrhenius graph of 1/T against ln k, always check units in axis, often x10 to the -3 or something weird
- Kp only changes with temperature so if something would change the equilibrium position, ratio of numerator to denominator will increase or decrease to restore original equilibrium
- % dissociation is $\frac{[H^+]}{[HA]} * 100$ 
- Dot and cross diagrams with ions - consider how the ions have formed, then the covalent bonds made afterwards. If you have a CO3 2- ion with 2 O- ions, then do the oxygen as normal, but show the "extra" electron with different symbol
	- These are likely/probably formed in a different reaction that leads to the formation of an O- ion that then bonds to the CO3 2- ion
- For titration readings, do not use mean titre and only use titres within 0.1cm^3
- Titrations involving iodine -> Use starch indicator
- Cu and Cr are anomalies in electron config, one of the 4s electrons moved to 3d to make it 3d5 or 3d10
- When asked about equilibrium of electrode potential questions, reference equilibrium of separate half cell reactions moving left or right (This is the "flipping" of the equation due to it being more negative)
