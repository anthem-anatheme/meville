- If comparing melting points, check if any have hydrogen bonding (F,O,N, and a hydrogen)
- Systematic name - oxidation state goes at end, in bracketed roman numerals
- For entropy, always talk about increase in disorder/more possible states
- For gas collection - Measuring Cylinder or Gas Syringe, with correct capacity and markings 
	- Or measure loss of mass - as gas produced mass will decrease
- Electrode potentials - Most negative is strongest reducing agent, positive is strongest oxidising agent

- ∆H hydration when one mole of **gaseous ions** dissolve in water to form one mole of **hydrated ions**
	- Affected by ionic radius and charge - attraction to **H2O molecules**
- Average bond enthalpy when one mole of bonds is broken, **in gaseous molecules**
- Arrhenius graph of 1/T against ln k, always check units in axis, often x10 to the -3 or something weird
- Kp only changes with temperature so if something would change the equilibrium position, ratio of numerator to denominator will increase or decrease to restore original equilibrium
- % dissociation is $\frac{[H^+]}{[HA]} * 100$ 
- Dot and cross diagrams with ions - consider how the ions have formed, then the covalent bonds made afterwards. If you have a CO3 2- ion with 2 O- ions, then do the oxygen as normal, but show the "extra" electron with different symbol
	- These are likely/probably formed in a different reaction that leads to the formation of an O- ion that then bonds to the CO3 2- ion
- For titration readings, do not use mean titre and only use titres within 0.1cm^3
- Titrations involving iodine -> Use starch indicator
- Cu and Cr are anomalies in electron config, one of the 4s electrons moved to 3d to make it 3d5 or 3d10
- When asked about equilibrium of electrode potential questions, reference equilibrium of separate half cell reactions moving left or right (This is the "flipping" of the equation due to it being more negative)
#### **[[Chemistry 2019 Paper 1.pdf|2019]]**
- For buffer solution long explanation, always talk about equilibrium change and the which reaction out of forward and backward will increase/decrease in rate
- Haemoglobin - Oxygen ligand substitutes H2O ligand in Fe2+ complex ion to form a dative bond by donating an electron pair at lungs, then is substituted again in low p(O2) areas by H2O to unload oxygen
	- CO dative bond to Fe2+ stronger than oxygens, so cannot be displaced so prevents oxygen being transported by haemoglobin
- Electrode potentials **always** mention equilibrium of half cell shifting to right, and the other to the left, mainly the one that is the focus of the question though
- Titrations - Lower concentration means larger titre so lower % uncertainty
- pH curves - check middle of vertical section is above/below 7 depending on combination of strong/weak acid/base
#### Other:
###### pH Curves:
- Start from higher for weak acid start point
- Equivalence point when moles of base equal to moles of acid
- End point when indicator changes colour
- When starting with weak base, initially (first cm3 or so) drops very quickly but only for a short period of time until buffer solution set up - then proceed as normal
	- Same for any weak acid in excess (getting alkaline added to it) + strong base
	- Also consider for weak acid + its salt
- For diprotic acids, consider the reaction in two parts, write out both equations and realise it will have 2 end points when each reaction is finished

###### Enthalpy of Solution:
- ∆H of solution when one mole of a solute is dissolved in water (to form an infinitely dilute solution
	- For ionic lattice, this is the enthalpy change when hydrating the ions minus enthalpy change of breaking the lattice
	- ∴ -∆H lattice + ∆H of hydration
- The more charged and smaller the ionic radius, the higher the enthalpy change of hydration - stronger bonds formed with water
- The higher the charge difference, and the smaller the ionic radius, the higher the lattice enthalpy (stronger bonds/attraction between ions)
###### Redox:
- MnO4- titrations self indicating - Goes from purple to pale pink/colourless
- I2 S2O3 - Starts brown from iodine, then add starch later and observe colour change from blue black to colourless/slightly brown
###### Transition Metals:
- Catalysts either by adsorbing other substance on surface to provide a surface for the reaction to happen on, or by changing oxidation state to provide a lower activation energy route
