- Polar/Non Polar molecules
	- Caused by dipoles - diff in electronegativity between atoms *Not C-H*
	- Dipole cancel out in symmetrical molecules
	- Polar when terminal atoms around centre are diff, and lone pairs (except XeF4, lone pairs opposite in this case)
- Orbitals only hold two electrons
- s orbitals spherical, p dumbell
- s,p,d,f subshells can hold 2,6,1
