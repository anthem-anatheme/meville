- Polar/Non Polar molecules
	- Caused by dipoles - diff in electronegativity between atoms *Not C-H*
	- Dipole cancel out in symmetrical molecules
	- Polar when terminal atoms around centre are diff, and lone pairs (except XeF4, lone pairs opposite in this case)
- Orbitals only hold two electrons
- s orbitals spherical, p dumbell
- s,p,d,f subshells can hold 2,6,10,14 (1,3,5,7 orbitals)
- m in q=mcâˆ†T is mass of liquid thermometer measuring
- âˆ†H combustion always negative/exothermic
- âˆ†H from experimental will always be diff to book because heat loss to surroundings, non standard conditions, incomplete combustion (of alcohols), specific heat cap of apparatus
- Always have sign in final answer for âˆ†H
- To set up calorimetry to find âˆ†H of neutralisation, use concentration to get equal moles H+ and OH-
- State symbols always in Born-Haber
- Check doubling of enthalpy change in calculation

- Kp only include gaseous species!
- >> means very on that side
- Value of Kc and Kp only change with temperature
	- Eq will shift when temp changes
- Sc and Zinc have 3d0 and 3d10 ions *only* so not transition
- Transition elements lose and gain 4s electrons first (Cu and Cr weird, have half full 4s)
- Only Cr(OH)3 dissolves in excess OH-
- Cr(OH)2 and Cu(OH)3 dissolve in excess NH3
- Cis and trans platin square planar
-
