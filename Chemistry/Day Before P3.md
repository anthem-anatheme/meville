- Polar/Non Polar molecules
	- Caused by dipoles - diff in electronegativity between atoms *Not C-H*
	- Dipole cancel out in symmetrical molecules
	- Polar when terminal atoms around centre are diff, and lone pairs (except XeF4, lone pairs opposite in this case)
- Orbitals only hold two electrons
- s orbitals spherical, p dumbell
- s,p,d,f subshells can hold 2,6,10,14 (1,3,5,7 orbitals)
- m in q=mc∆T is mass of liquid thermometer measuring
- ∆H combustion always negative/exothermic
- ∆H from experimental will always be diff to book because heat loss to surroundings, non standard conditions, incomplete combustion (of alcohols), specific heat cap of apparatus
- Always have sign in final answer for ∆H
- To set up calorimetry to find ∆H of neutralisation, use concentration to get equal moles H+ and OH-
- State symbols always in Born-Haber
- Check doubling of enthalpy change in calculation
