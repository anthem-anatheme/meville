1. Radical reacts with ozone (O3) and accepts an O to form a new radical and a single O
2. Then radical reformed by reacting with O to form O2 and radical
3. Basically, radical takes O from ozone and gives it to another O molecule
	1. The second O atom is probably also formed by UV light
	2. Yep, UV light sets up equilibrium between O2 + O â‡Œ O3
4. Same/similar method for basically all O3 decomp mechanisms
