###### Excess Weak Acid and Base
Find moles of acid and base initially and after reaction, then sub into Ka equation
	N.B. Acid will be in excess so moles of base will equal some multiple of moles of A-/conjugate salt
###### Acid - Salt
Find moles, then concentration of acid and salt and plug into Ka equation, then solve for whatever needed
