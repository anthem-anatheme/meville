![[screenshot.png]] Plan to try this today, let future me know how.

Woke up honestly shocked, thought today was a school day and cane downstairs to find brother on the VR. Got up with no scrolling or anything today, feeling pretty good.

Marked [[2024 OCR Paper 1]] from yesterday, pretty good. Honestly I'd forgotten how easy most of the topics on it are, just some pretty simple algebra for calculations, hardest part is probably drawing tangents and best fit lines lol. Most marks lost were due to not reading q properly, although fuel cells and shit are still hard for me to think about, might have to drill some more questions.
